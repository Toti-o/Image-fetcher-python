This is a Python tool to download images from URLs.
Enter one or more URLs, and images are saved to `Fetched_Images`. Automatically skips duplicates and handles errors.

## How It Works

1. User inputs one or more image URLs.
2. The script checks if each URL points to an actual image.
3. It calculates a hash for each image to avoid downloading duplicates.
4. Images are saved to the `Fetched_Images` folder.
5. Any network or download errors are shown but do not stop the program.
